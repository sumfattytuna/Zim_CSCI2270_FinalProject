# Zim_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summmary:
	For this project I will be taking the code used already for assignment 9.
This code involves creating a hashtable of movies, storing the title of the movie
and its respective year in an array of different linked lists.  There is a sum
that gives each title an index value that allows for faster search methods.  If 
more than one different movie have the same index, we will create a linked list
in a process called chaining.  
	In this project I will be implementing the code so that in addition to 
adding new movies, deleting movies, searching for a movie, and printing the 
entire hash table, the program will be able to read in a text file into the hash table
(we will be using the movie file from assignment 5), store more values than just the \
year of the movie, such as imdb rating, and the ability to create a new txt file
that is updated with the newly deleted or inserted movies.

How to Run:

Dependencies: 
	For this program we will be using linux.  The code will also be requiring the 
standard library as well as g++11 to compile.

System requirements:  This is written using linux, it can be accessible from a mac 
if xcode is installed.
